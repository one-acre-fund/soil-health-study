# Longitudinal soil health study
This is the master repo for 1AF Kenya and Rwanda soil health studies. The objectives of the longitudinal soil health study are:

* Better understand the long-term effect of the One Acre Fund program on various soil health indicators and behaviors.
* Define the economic value of soil health for One Acre Fund farmers through the pairing of soil samples with on-farm yield measurements.
* Determine which products and practices most effectively improve soil health for One Acre Fund farmers through longitudinal, country-level agronomic trials.

The longitudinal soil health study focuses on the first of those objectives by following a set of plots over time. Information on the cultivation methods used on those plots is recorded as well as if it received 1AF inputs. The movement of plots in and out of 1AF cultivation over time allows us to isolate the portion of the soil health outcome attributable to being a 1AF farmer.

You will notice that there are not folders for `ke round 2` and `rw round 2`. These data were directly analyzed in the `shs_analysis` folder.
